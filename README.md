## Non-Affiliation Statement

## Running locally

No dependencies. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it with any static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuring the live stream

At the top of the `<script>` block in `index.html`, update `SHOW_CONFIG`:

```js
const SHOW_CONFIG = {
  title:       "Show name",
  host:        "Hosted by ...",
  description: "Show description.",
  streamUrl:   "https://your-stream-url.here"  // leave empty when offline
};
```

When `streamUrl` is empty the live section shows an offline notice automatically.

## Deployment

Push to `main` — GitHub Pages deploys automatically via the `CNAME` record pointing to `waveonpulse.com`.
